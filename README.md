# Suzanne's Sales Manager
An internal project for Suzanne's Natural Foods meant to simplify adding large numbers of "on sale" items in our point of sale system.

Making this public, possibly temporarily, for the sake of CI app integrations and maybe for sharing with potential job interviewers.

## Note on Crappy Code
At the time this was written, I had never imagined sharing this code with anyone so please take my coding style, commits, etc. with a big grain of salt. A lot of code was simply hacked in as needed in our day to day operations. I plan to work on some refactoring and cleanup soon.
